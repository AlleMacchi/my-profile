        "overview":"Berneck has a history dating back to its establishment in 1952.The company is headquartered in Curitibanos, Santa Catarina, Brazil. Berneck is known for its involvement in the production of wood-based products. This includes plywood and other engineered wood products. The company may also be involved in the production of MDF (Medium Density Fiberboard), an engineered wood product widely used in furniture and construction. As with many companies in the wood industry, sustainability and responsible forestry practices are crucial. Companies like Berneck often emphasize sustainable sourcing of raw materials and responsible environmental practices. Berneck likely has a significant presence in the Brazilian and possibly international markets, providing wood products for construction, furniture, and other industries. Successful companies in the wood industry often invest in modern technologies for manufacturing processes, quality control, and sustainability measures. Berneck might be incorporating advanced technologies in its production systems.",
