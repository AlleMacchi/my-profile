<h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
<p><span>Automatic product entry system to the warehouse:</span> 
The entry and exit system of the automated warehouse was designed to handle products without pallets and with pallets. 
For products without a pallet, the system inserted a pallet under it before proceeding with wrapping. 
After wrapping, a shape check was carried out to verify that the product was suitable for storage. 
Additionally, a barcode control system was used to enter the product into the management system. 
</p>
<br />
<p>
If the check was successful, the pallet was transported from the warehouse loading bays, where an LGV (remotely guided vehicle) took it to its final allocation. 
For products with double pallets on top of each other, the system included a depalletizing system that separated the double pallets before proceeding with the 
shape and label control. After checking, the pallet was transported to the warehouse loading docks, where the LGV took it to its final allocation. 
If the checks were not successful, the pallet was transported to a reject bay and a message was shown on a display.

<p>
The system was designed to be easily usable and customizable, thanks to the use of an HMI (human-machine interface) programmed in <span>Factory Talk.</span> 
This allowed operators to easily manage the system and adapt it to the specific needs of the warehouse.
