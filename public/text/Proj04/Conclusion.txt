    In conclusion, the automatic warehouse entry and exit system has proven to be an excellent solution for 
    managing products without pallets and with pallets. Thanks to the shape and barcode control system, 
    the system is able to guarantee that the products are suitable for storage, minimizing the risk of errors or damage. 
    Additionally, using an HMI programmed in Factory Talk made the system easy to use and customize, allowing operators 
    to easily manage the system and adapt it to specific warehouse needs. All this has contributed to making the system 
    an excellent option for managing automated warehouses.
