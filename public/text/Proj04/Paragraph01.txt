<h2>Production Process</h2>
<br />
<p> 
The production process of an infeed and outfeed automatic warehouse system for pallets, utilizing LGV (Laser-Guided Vehicles) and roller conveyors, typically involves several key steps. Below is a general overview of the process:
</p>
<br />

<p><span>Receiving and Unloading:</span>
Pallets carrying goods arrive at the facility on trucks.
The trucks are directed to specific unloading bays where the pallets are unloaded.
</p>
<br />

<p><span>Inspection and Data Capture:</span>
Pallets are inspected for quality and accuracy.
Data related to each pallet, such as product type, quantity, and destination, is captured and recorded in the system.
</p>
<br />

<p><span>Conveyor System Integration:</span>
Pallets are placed on the infeed conveyor system.
The infeed conveyor system may include sensors for detecting pallets, ensuring proper spacing, and facilitating the smooth flow of pallets onto the conveyor.
</p>
<br />

<p><span>Automated Guided Vehicles (LGV) Handling:</span>
LGVs, which are equipped with guidance systems such as lasers or magnets, navigate through the facility autonomously.
LGVs pick up pallets from the infeed conveyor system and transport them to designated storage locations within the warehouse.
</p>
<br />

<p><span>Storage in Automated Racking System:</span>
The warehouse is equipped with an automated racking system where LGVs deposit the pallets.
The racking system is designed to optimize storage space and facilitate efficient retrieval.
</p>
<br />

<p><span>Inventory Management:</span>
The warehouse management system (WMS) keeps track of the inventory, including the location of each pallet within the automated storage system.
</p>
<br />

<p><span>Order Processing:</span>
When an order is received, the WMS identifies the location of the required pallets.
The LGVs retrieve the pallets from their storage locations and transport them to the outfeed area.
</p>
<br />

<p><span>Outfeed Conveyor System:</span>
The outfeed conveyor system receives pallets from the storage area and transports them toward the loading bays.
</p>
<br />

<p><span>Loading onto Trucks:</span>
Pallets are loaded onto trucks at the designated loading bays.
</p>
<br />

<p><span>Data Logging and Reporting:</span>
Throughout the process, data is logged and recorded for traceability and reporting purposes.
Any discrepancies or issues in the process are flagged for corrective action.
</p>
<br />

<p><span>Maintenance and Monitoring:</span>
Regular maintenance is conducted on the conveyor systems, LGVs, and other components to ensure smooth operation.
Real-time monitoring systems are in place to detect and address any faults or malfunctions promptly.
