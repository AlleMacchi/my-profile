    <p><span>Smart filling system:</span> The system was composed of a roller transport, 
            with sensors that determined the size and material of each individual can, depending on the type of can, 
            the system independently moved the stops of the product, sent the data for the quantity of filling and stopped at 
            the correct capping station, furthermore, different types of cans could be inserted, given that the system was 
            able to recognize their type. In addition to handling, I also managed the capping cycles and data exchange with 
            the filler. The HMI (Human-Machine Interface) was implemented using WinCC from Siemens. Overall, the system was 
            highly automated and efficient, with the ability to handle a variety of barrel types and sizes. The use of sensors 
            and data exchange with the filler ensured accurate and consistent filling, while the HMI provided easy control 
            and monitoring of the system.
